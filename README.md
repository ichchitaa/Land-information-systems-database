# Land-information-systems-database
I did an internship with Bahwan Cybertek in Muscat, Oman. We were working within a land assignment project started by the Ministry of Housing in Oman, which 
intended to provide housing to residents in a way that is sustainable (the housing lasts them a long time), and is also equitable (people of all incomes and 
backgrounds are provided good quality housing). People can apply for housing and the Ministry of Housing provides them with the best choice for their background 
and needs. The project team in Bahwan Cybertek was working on the backend data modeling in the process of organizing data and assigning housing optimally. 

The important entities in the data modeling were People (to track involved parties such as customers, their background and their land application), 
Land (the buildings and plots of land available) and Ownership (to track what land is owned by whom, or is open for sale). 

I built logical and physical models of the attributes of and relationships between customers and plots of land. Finally, I created a relational database using 
MySQL to represent the land information system with its 3 main entities and all their attributes. Attached are the SQL files for the database created for each 
of these entities.
